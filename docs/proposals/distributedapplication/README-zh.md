# Application of distributed

## Summary

In the progress of a resource(as known as `resource template`) propagating to cluster, Karmada take actions according to
the resource definition. For example, at the phase of building `ResourceBinding`, the `karmada-controller` will parse 
the `replicas` from resource templates like `deployments` but do nothing for resources that don't have `replicas`. 

For the Kubernetes native resources, Karmada knows how to parse them. But for custom resource type, as lack of the 
knowledge of the structure, Karmada treat the custom resource type as a general resource.

This proposal aims to provide a solution for users to teach Karmada to learn their custom resources.

## Motivation

Nowadays, lots of people or projects extend Kubernetes by `Custom Resource Defination`. In order to propagate the 
custom resources, Karmada has to learn the structure of the custom resource.

### Goals

- Provide a solution to support custom resources by teaching Karmada the resource structure.

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### As a user, I want to propagate my custom resource(workload type with replicas) to leverage the Karmada replica scheduling capabilities.

I have a custom resource which extremely similar with `deployments`, it has a `replica` field as well, I want to `divide`
the replicas to multiple clusters by declaring a `ReplicaScheduling` rule.

> In this scenario, as lack of knowledge of the custom resource, Karmada can't grab it's `replica`.

#### As a user, I want to customize the retain method for my CRD resources.

I have a custom resource which reconciling by a controller running in member clusters. The controllers would make changes
to the resource(such as update status), I wish Karmada could retain the changes make by my controller.

> In this sceanrio, as lack of knowledge of the custom resource, Karmada might can't retain the custom resource correctly.
> Thus, the resource might be changed back and forth by Karmada and it's controller.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

### Risks and Mitigations

## Design Details

Inspire of the [Kubernetes Admission webhook][1], we propose a webhook called `ResourceExploringWebhook` which contains:
- A configuration API `ResourceExploringWebhookConfiguration` to declare the enabled webhooks.
- A review API `ExploreReview` to declare the request and response between Karmada and webhooks.

In the `ResourceExploringWebhookConfiguration` API, the `OperationType` represents the request that Karmada might call
the webhooks in the whole propagating process.

### New ResourceExploringWebhookConfiguration API

We propose a new CR in `config.karmada.io` group.

### Example
#### Configuration
The example below show two webhooks configuration.
The `foo.example.com` webhook serves for `foos` under `foo.example.com` group and implemented `ExploreRetaining` and 
`ExploreHealthy` operations.
The `bar.example.com` webhook serves for `bars` under `bar.example.com` group and implemented `ExploreDependencies` and 
`ExploreHealthy` operations.

```yaml
apiVersion: config.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceExploringWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: example
webhooks:
  - name: foo.example.com
    rules:
      - operations: ["ExploreRetaining", "ExploreHealthy"]
        apiGroups: ["foo.example.com"]
        apiVersions: ["*"]
        resources: ["foos"]
        scope: "Namespaced"
    clientConfig:
      url: https://xxx:443/explore-foo
      caBundle: {{caBundle}}
    failurePolicy: Fail
    exploreReviewVersions: ["v1alpha1"]
    timeoutSeconds: 3
  - name: bar.example.com
    rules:
      - operations: ["ExploreDependencies", "ExploreHealthy"]
        apiGroups: ["bar.example.com"]
        apiVersions: ["*"]
        resources: ["bars"]
        scope: "Cluster"
    clientConfig:
      url: https://xxx:443/explore-bar
      caBundle: {{caBundle}}
    failurePolicy: Fail
    exploreReviewVersions: ["v1alpha1"]
    timeoutSeconds: 3
```
#### Request and Response
Take `ExploreHealthy` for example, Karmada will send the request like:
```yaml
apiVersion: config.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExploreReview
request:
  - uid: xxx
  - Kind:
    - group: foo.example.com
      version: v1alpha1
      Kind: Foo
  - name: foo
  - namespace: default
  - operation: ExploreHealthy
  - object: <raw data of the object>
```

And the response like:
```yaml
apiVersion: config.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExploreReview
response:
  - uid: xxx(same uid in the request)
  - healthy: true
```

### Test Plan

- Propose E2E test cases according the operations described above.

## Alternatives

The proposal [Configurable Local Value Retention][2] described a solution to retain custom resource, but the 
configuration would be a little complex to users.
